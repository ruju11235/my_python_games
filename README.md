# my_python_games
Starting Python through some games!

The first game that I am going to write is Cows and Bulls.
The flowchart is here: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11HkjNEgbZtt4t8LXcgaSUEd2gNh_nhrWtDxenNmgyEI/edit.
I am going to make the guesses in the game and my program is going to tell me if the guesses are correct.
